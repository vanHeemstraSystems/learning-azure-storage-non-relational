# Determine the storage tier
Blob storage is an object store used for storing vast amounts of unstructured data.

|Tier|Storage Costs|Retrieval Costs|Storage Duration|Usage Cases|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Premium|High|Lowest|N/A|- High throughput and large numbers of I/O operations per second.|
|Hot|Medium|Low|N/A|- Active and frequent use.<br/>-Data staged for processing.|
|Cool|Low|Medium|> 30 days|- Short-term backup.<br/>- Older media infrequently viewed.<br/>- Large data sets.|
|Archive|Lowest|High|> 180 days|- Long-term backup.<br/>- Original (raw) data.<br/>- Compliance or archival data.|

- Use lifecycle rules to transition blob data to the appropriate access tiers.
- Consider a data lifecycle rule to expire or delete data.
