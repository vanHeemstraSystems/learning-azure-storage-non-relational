# Consider immutable storage policies
Determine regulatory compliance, secure document retention, and legal hold policies.

![Immutable Storage Policies](../images/immutable-storage-policies.png)

- Apply immutable storage policies at the container level.
- Use **time-based retention policies** for business-critical data.
- Use **legal-hold policies** for sensitive information to ensure a tamper proof state.
- Policies apply only to new content.
- Audit logs are available.
