# Design a storage solution for Tailwind Traders
Determine regulatory compliance, secure document retention, and legal hold policies.

![Immutable Storage Policies](../images/storage-solution-for-tailwind-traders.png)

- What type of data is represented?
- What factors will you consider in your design?
- What type of storage accounts are needed?
- Will you use blob access tiers?
- Will you use immutable storage?
- How will the content be securiy accessed?

Your solution should consider the media, marketing literature, and corporate documents.
